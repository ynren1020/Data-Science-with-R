Hypothesis ----

Types of Hypothesis
-Simple hypothesis
-Complex hypothesis
-Null hypothesis
-Alternate hypothesis is used to decide whether to employ a one-tailed test or two-tailed test
-Statistical hypothesis

Data Sampling ----

Data sampling is a statistical hypothesis technique used to select, manipulate, and analyze a subset of data points to discover hidden patterns and trends in the larger data set.
The sampling theory draws valid inferences about the population parameters on the basis of sample results.

Types of Errors 
Type I Error - reject H0 when it is true, denoted by alpha
Type II Error - reject H1 when it is true, denoted by beta

Confidence Levels ----
The confidence level is the frequency of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of their corresponding parameter
A confidence interval is a type of interval estimate that is computed from the observed data
Confidence interval for a normal distribution is evaluated for continuous variables like sales in dollars, income of customers, etc.

critical region
The sampling distribution of a test statistic has two regions - a region of rejection (critical region) and a region of acceptance.
