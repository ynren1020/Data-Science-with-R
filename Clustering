Clustering methods
Prototype-based clustering 
- (K-means, use centroid to calculate distance to each data points) assigning training data to match clusters based on similarity; Iterative process to get data points in the best clusters possible 
- Case study with time series data of unemployment data for 50 states
- numeric variable, factor or categorical will introduce NA which generate error when fit K-means model

Hierarchical clustering
- Agglomerative (bottom up) - Divisive (Top down)
- case study (25 countries with 9 sources of protein intake)
Density-based clustering 
- (DBSCAN, Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise) is used to identify clusters of any shape in a dataset containing noise and outliers.
