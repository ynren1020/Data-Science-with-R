An association rule is a pattern that states when X occurs, Y occurs with a certain probability.
X => Y where, X, Y belong to I, and X intersects Y is not NULL
Association rule is not suitable for numeric data and assumes all data elements to be categorical.


Apriori algorithm
library(arules)
Groceries_Item = read.transactions("Groceries.csv", sep = ",")
AprioriForGroceries = apriori(Groceries_Item, parameter=list(support=.006,confidence=.5)
summary(AprioriForGroceries)
inspect(AprioriForGroceries) # lhs find the cause and rhs find the result

inspect(sort(AprioriForGroceries, by="confidence")) # sort by confidence level

Key Takeaways 
Association rule mining finds interesting patterns in a dataset
The interesting relationships can have two parameters: frequent item sets and association rules
An association rule is a pattern that states when X occurs, Y occurs with a certain probability
The measures of the strength of association rules are support and confidence
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases
The Apriori algorithm includes two steps: mining all frequent item sets and generating rules from frequent item sets

Association rules are interesting if they satisfy both minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds
