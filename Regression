Regression analysis is a technique used to estimate the relationship between variables and predict the value of one variable (dependent variable) on the basis of other variables (independent variables).

Types of regression analysis models ----
Linear regression 
  - simple linear - method of least squares - coefficient of multiple determination - standard error of the estimate - dummy variable - interaction
Non-linear regression
  - polynomial - logarithmic - square root - reciprocal - exponential

standard deviation is for the population, standard error is for the sample.
